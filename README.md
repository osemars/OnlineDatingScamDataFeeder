# OnlineDatingScamDataFeeder
Incase you're wondering or disturbed about a trend...This app uses a TensorFlow Lite model to predicts if you are currently 
in a relationship with a scammer or not...

It asks a couple of questions and uses that as the input and outputs a probability that it is a scam.

I build the dataset myself with information from blogs and online scammers (i acted as an undercover detective).

I havent worked on the UI/UX much as I had the idea and decided to build it and see if it works and it did.

This could help save someone's insanity, reputation, life savings or life.
